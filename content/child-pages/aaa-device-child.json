    "description": "Successful aneurysm repair requires stent grafts that seal completely against vessel walls under continuous aortic pressure, prevent blood from leaking back into the aneurysm sac, and maintain that seal for years without migration. We test high-pressure containment performance, measure all four endoleak types, validate modular component integration, and confirm your device withstands mechanical stresses of the aortic environment."

    "description": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair presents a unique challenge in vascular intervention. Your stent graft must contain blood under the highest pressures in the body while sealing against vessel walls that may be irregular, calcified, or angulated. Any gap between the device and vessel wall creates an endoleak that defeats the purpose of the repair by allowing blood to pressurize the aneurysm sac. The device must also resist the constant downward force of pulsatile blood flow that can cause migration over time, particularly in short or angulated necks.\n\nWe test AAA devices using high-pressure aortic simulators that replicate systolic pressures up to 200 mmHg with anatomically accurate aneurysm models including infrarenal configurations and juxtarenal anatomies. Pressure sensors throughout the system detect any blood flow into the aneurysm sac, identifying Type I endoleaks at attachment zones, Type II leaks from lumbar or inferior mesenteric arteries, Type III leaks between modular components, and Type IV leaks through graft material porosity. We measure the force required to dislodge your device from proximal and distal seal zones, test integrity across different neck angulations and diameters from 18mm to 32mm, and run accelerated fatigue cycles simulating decades of cardiac pulsation.\n\nOur protocols follow FDA guidance for endovascular AAA devices, typically pursuing the 510(k) pathway with substantial equivalence to predicate devices or PMA for novel configurations. Testing demonstrates complete aneurysm exclusion, adequate seal zone fixation through hooks or barbs or oversizing alone, and maintained structural integrity over the intended device life. We measure performance against ISO 7198 standards for cardiovascular implants, with specific emphasis on high-pressure containment and long-term durability requirements unique to aortic applications where device failure carries life-threatening consequences.",
