    "description": "Robotic abdominal surgery platforms must provide wristed instrument manipulation in confined spaces, maintain stable camera positioning during complex dissection, and enable suturing with degrees of freedom exceeding human wrist capability. We test instrument articulation range through laparoscopic ports, measure tissue handling force control, validate trocar placement accuracy, and confirm visualization system integration for both 510(k) and PMA pathways."

    "description": "Robotic abdominal surgery systems enhance laparoscopic technique by providing wristed instruments, tremor filtration, and motion scaling that overcome limitations of conventional rigid laparoscopic tools. Your platform must deliver multiple articulating instruments through small abdominal wall ports, provide three-dimensional visualization superior to standard laparoscopy, and enable complex tasks like intracorporeal suturing with precision exceeding manual laparoscopic technique. The system must accommodate varying patient anatomy from obese to thin body habitus while maintaining workspace free of instrument collisions and providing adequate reach throughout the abdominal cavity.\n\nWe test robotic abdominal surgery platforms using tissue models and organ simulators that replicate laparoscopic surgical challenges. Instrument articulation assessment measures range of motion through trocar ports, evaluating whether wristed instruments achieve the degrees of freedom necessary for complex dissection and suturing in confined spaces. Force control protocols validate that haptic feedback or force limiting prevents excessive tissue trauma during manipulation. Visualization system testing confirms camera stability during instrument movement, measures depth perception with stereoscopic displays, and evaluates image quality during energy device activation. We assess setup efficiency including trocar placement accuracy, workspace optimization across patient sizes, and emergency undocking procedures.\n\nISO 13485 quality management and IEC 60601 electrical safety standards guide robotic surgical system development while human factors testing addresses learning curves and operator proficiency. Our testing supports 510(k) pathways for robotic surgical systems with predicate devices and PMA submissions for novel platform configurations or capabilities. Whether validating a multi-port robotic platform for complex abdominal procedures or characterizing a single-port system for reduced-incision surgery, our protocols address the instrument articulation, visualization quality, force control, and procedural integration that robotic abdominal surgery validation requires.",
