    "description": "Cardiac rhythm management devices sustain life through precise electrical therapy, requiring validation that demonstrates reliable sensing, appropriate pacing, and effective arrhythmia termination across varying physiological conditions. Pacemakers must detect intrinsic cardiac activity while delivering therapy that maintains adequate heart rate without depleting battery reserves prematurely. ICDs face the additional challenge of discriminating life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias from benign rhythms while delivering high-voltage therapy that terminates fibrillation without causing unnecessary shocks that traumatize patients and accelerate device replacement.\n\nWe evaluate electrical performance using specialized electrophysiology systems that capture pacing thresholds, sensing amplitudes, and impedance measurements with microsecond precision. Our catheterization laboratories feature programmable cardiac simulation systems, real-time rhythm analysis capabilities, and high-voltage testing infrastructure that characterizes defibrillation efficacy across multiple energy levels. From sensing algorithm validation to battery longevity projection, our protocols address the complex interaction between device electronics, lead systems, and cardiac tissue throughout chronic implantation periods.\n\nISO 14708 series standards guide cardiac device assessment while FDA guidance documents for active implantable medical devices inform protocol development. Whether validating leadless pacemaker platforms, MRI-conditional ICD systems, or cardiac resynchronization therapy devices, our GLP-compliant testing addresses both PMA pathway requirements and post-market surveillance objectives for Class III life-sustaining devices.",
