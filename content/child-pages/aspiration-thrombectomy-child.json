        "description": "Direct aspiration thrombectomy catheters rely on vacuum-generated suction forces to extract thrombus material from occluded cerebral vessels, requiring optimization of catheter inner diameter, tip geometry, and aspiration system performance. The ADAPT (A Direct Aspiration first Pass Technique) approach demands large-bore catheter designs that maximize flow rates while maintaining trackability through tortuous neurovascular access routes. Even small increases in catheter inner diameter significantly enhance aspiration effectiveness, making lumen optimization critical for first-pass recanalization success.\n\nWe evaluate aspiration catheter performance using controlled flow circuits that quantify vacuum force generation at the catheter tip while measuring clot extraction rates across standardized thrombus compositions. Our cerebrovascular phantom systems replicate internal carotid and middle cerebral artery geometries enabling navigation assessment through representative access challenges. Specialized protocols compare aspiration-only approaches against combined aspiration-retrieval techniques while quantifying complete recanalization rates and distal embolization prevention.\n\nFDA guidance for neurothrombectomy devices requires demonstration of clot removal effectiveness alongside navigation capability validation. ISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide catheter material assessment while device-specific protocols address aspiration force characterization, tip suction quantification, and vessel wall interaction. Our GLP-compliant testing supports 510(k) pathways for aspiration thrombectomy systems. Whether validating next-generation large-bore aspiration catheters or optimized tip designs for enhanced clot engagement, our protocols generate data addressing FDA expectations for acute ischemic stroke treatment devices.",
