    "description": "Bone healing devices must demonstrate fixation stability maintaining fracture reduction while supporting biological healing progression through inflammatory, soft callus, hard callus, and remodeling phases. Metallic fixation plates require biomechanical strength validation withstanding physiological loads while bioresorbable systems need degradation rate characterization synchronized with tissue strength development. Bone graft substitutes demand osteoconductivity demonstration supporting new bone formation while osteoinductive materials require bone formation stimulation validation in non-healing defect models. Orthobiologic adjuncts including growth factors and stem cell therapies need mechanism of action characterization proving healing acceleration and quality enhancement. Each technology category addresses different healing scenarios from simple fracture stabilization to critical-size defect regeneration requiring comprehensive validation approaches.\n\nWe evaluate healing progression using micro-computed tomography imaging that quantifies bone mineral density, callus volume, trabecular architecture, and cortical bridging throughout healing time courses. Biomechanical testing measures construct stiffness, ultimate load to failure, and energy absorption characterizing mechanical property restoration while comparing healed bone strength to native tissue. Histomorphometry protocols quantify new bone area, bone formation rate, and osteoid thickness using fluorochrome labeling and calcein double-marking techniques. Our capabilities include histopathological examination characterizing callus composition, cellular infiltration patterns, and cartilaginous intermediate stages during endochondral ossification. We assess device-bone integration quality, fixation stability under cyclic loading, and absence of stress shielding effects compromising healing. Advanced imaging tracks healing progression non-invasively while terminal analyses provide quantitative tissue-level characterization.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide bone tissue contact assessment while ASTM orthopedic device standards including F382 and F1635 address specific mechanical testing requirements for fixation devices. FDA orthopedic guidance documents inform protocol development for both trauma fixation devices and regenerative bone therapies requiring osteogenic effectiveness demonstration. Testing supports 510(k) pathways demonstrating substantial equivalence to cleared fixation systems and PMA submissions for breakthrough bone healing technologies requiring comprehensive effectiveness validation. Whether characterizing plate-screw construct stability, validating bone graft substitute osteoconduction, or assessing growth factor osteoinduction, our protocols generate data meeting orthopedic device regulatory expectations.",
