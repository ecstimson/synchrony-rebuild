    "description": "Cardiopulmonary bypass systems temporarily replace cardiac and pulmonary function during open-heart surgical procedures, requiring validation that demonstrates reliable gas exchange while minimizing blood trauma throughout extended circulation periods. These extracorporeal circuits must maintain adequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal while blood pumps deliver precise flow rates across varying systemic resistances. Membrane oxygenators demand specialized assessment of oxygen transfer efficiency, CO2 clearance capacity, and blood-side pressure drop while integrated heat exchangers regulate temperature during cardioplegia induction and rewarming phases.\n\nWe evaluate bypass circuit performance using blood gas analyzers that quantify partial pressures throughout oxygenator transit while hemolysis measurement systems detect red cell damage and platelet activation across flow ranges typical of cardiac surgery. Our mock circulation loops replicate physiologic pressures and resistance while specialized test fixtures enable pump flow characterization, membrane surface area optimization, and priming volume assessment. Hemocompatibility protocols measure complement activation, leukocyte degranulation, and fibrinogen consumption using ISO 10993-4 standards adapted for short-term extracorporeal circulation applications where blood contact surfaces exceed standard implant testing requirements.\n\nISO 7199 standards for blood-gas exchangers guide membrane oxygenator validation while ISO 10993 biocompatibility requirements address circuit material selection and blood contact surface treatment. FDA guidance for cardiopulmonary bypass systems informs protocol development addressing gas transfer efficiency benchmarks, heat exchanger safety limits, and blood damage thresholds. Our testing supports 510(k) pathways for established oxygenator designs and PMA submissions for novel membrane technologies. Whether validating hollow-fiber oxygenators, centrifugal pump platforms, or integrated bypass consoles, our protocols demonstrate gas exchange capacity, hemodynamic performance, and hemocompatibility across the flow rates and perfusion durations cardiac surgical procedures require.",
