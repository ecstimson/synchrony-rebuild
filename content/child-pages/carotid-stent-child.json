    "description": "Success in carotid stenting depends on opening blocked arteries without releasing plaque fragments that could cause stroke. We test how your device compresses plaque, measure particles released during deployment, track vessel scaffolding performance, and verify that cerebral blood flow remains adequate throughout the procedure for both 510(k) and PMA pathways."

    "description": "Carotid stents face a unique challenge that doesn't exist in other vascular territories. The plaque you're treating is the same material that causes stroke if fragments break loose. Your device must compress unstable plaque against the vessel wall, maintain that compression long-term, and accomplish both without releasing particles into cerebral circulation. This requires testing that tracks embolic generation during every phase of deployment while verifying that the stent provides adequate vessel scaffolding without compromising blood flow to the brain.\n\nWe test carotid stents using anatomically accurate carotid bifurcation models with pulsatile flow systems that replicate cerebral circulation patterns. High-resolution particle tracking captures debris released during deployment and expansion, measuring both size and quantity of embolic material down to 40 microns. Flow velocity measurement confirms adequate cerebral perfusion throughout the procedure, while radial force testing validates that your stent maintains plaque compression under arterial pressure. We evaluate both self-expanding nitinol designs and balloon-expandable systems across different stenosis severities and plaque compositions including calcified lesions and soft lipid-rich material.\n\nOur protocols align with FDA guidance for carotid stent devices, typically following the 510(k) pathway with substantial equivalence to predicate devices. Testing demonstrates embolic safety during deployment, adequate revascularization of the stenosed segment, and maintained vessel patency over time. We measure performance against ISO 25539 standards for cardiovascular stents, with specific emphasis on cerebrovascular safety parameters that distinguish carotid applications from coronary or other peripheral uses including unique embolic risk profiles.",
