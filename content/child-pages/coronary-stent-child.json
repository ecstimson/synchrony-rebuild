    "description": "Coronary stent development requires validation that addresses mechanical performance, biological safety, and therapeutic efficacy across diverse platform types. Drug-eluting stents face additional complexity as combination products requiring integrated assessment of device mechanics, polymer coating performance, and pharmacological activity. Whether validating bare metal platforms through radial strength and biocompatibility testing or characterizing drug-eluting systems with complex elution profiles, successful regulatory submissions demand comprehensive preclinical data addressing FDA expectations for both immediate performance and long-term vascular healing.\n\nWe evaluate mechanical integrity through radial force measurement, crush resistance assessment, and accelerated durability protocols that simulate years of cardiac loading. Our catheterization laboratories feature high-resolution fluoroscopy and intravascular ultrasound capabilities enabling deployment characterization in anatomically accurate coronary models. For drug-eluting platforms, specialized analytical systems quantify drug release kinetics through HPLC analysis while tissue distribution studies map therapeutic agent penetration patterns in vessel walls. Polymer coating assessment utilizes scanning electron microscopy and advanced imaging techniques identifying uniformity, adhesion characteristics, and structural integrity throughout deployment sequences.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide material evaluation while ISO 25539 specifications inform mechanical testing protocols for vascular stents. Drug-eluting platforms require additional FDA guidance consideration addressing combination product requirements, drug-specific toxicology, and polymer biocompatibility assessment. Our testing addresses both 510(k) substantial equivalence demonstrations and PMA pathway requirements for breakthrough technologies, providing complete validation packages supporting regulatory submissions across bare metal designs, established drug-eluting platforms, bioresorbable scaffolds, and novel therapeutic combinations.",
