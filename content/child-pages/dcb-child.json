    "description": "Peripheral drug-coated balloons must transfer therapeutic paclitaxel concentrations into long diseased segments, maintain coating integrity through tortuous iliac and femoral anatomy, and provide sustained antiproliferative effects in vessels subject to extreme biomechanical forces. We test coating uniformity across long balloons, drug transfer in calcified vessels, tissue pharmacokinetics through extended lesions, and primary patency outcomes for femoropopliteal and below-the-knee applications."

    "description": "Peripheral drug-coated balloons face challenges that differ fundamentally from coronary applications. Femoropopliteal and popliteal lesions often extend 100-200mm, requiring drug transfer across much longer vessel segments than coronary interventions. Peripheral arteries frequently have heavy calcification that affects balloon-vessel contact and drug uptake. Below-the-knee vessels present small diameters combined with long diseased segments and poor runoff that influences drug retention. The paclitaxel coating must survive navigation through tortuous iliac and femoral anatomy, maintain drug stability during balloon preparation, then transfer therapeutic concentrations during inflation times that may be longer than coronary procedures.\n\nWe test peripheral DCB using vessel models replicating femoropopliteal anatomy including heavy calcification and long lesion lengths up to 200mm. Coating adhesion studies measure drug retention through tortuous iliac access while particulate testing quantifies coating loss during balloon deflation across extended surface areas. Drug transfer kinetics protocols evaluate paclitaxel uptake as a function of balloon contact pressure, inflation duration, and vessel wall characteristics including calcification severity. Tissue pharmacokinetic analysis tracks drug concentration in peripheral arterial layers from immediate post-inflation through 6-month follow-up, validating sustained antiproliferative effects necessary for primary patency in vessels subject to continuous mechanical stress.\n\nPeripheral DCB applications focus on femoropopliteal disease where restenosis rates historically exceeded 50% and below-the-knee interventions where treatment options remain limited. ISO 10993 biocompatibility addresses peripheral tissue exposure to higher total drug doses from long lesion treatment while combination product regulations require demonstrating primary patency benefit. Our testing supports 510(k) pathways for paclitaxel-formulation variations and PMA submissions for novel excipient systems or drug platforms. Whether validating coating durability for femoropopliteal applications or measuring drug transfer for below-the-knee small vessels, our peripheral testing addresses the long-lesion coverage and biomechanical challenges central to peripheral DCB performance.",
