    "description": "Drug-eluting stents face unique validation challenges as combination products requiring both device and drug assessment. We test drug release patterns, polymer coating performance, tissue uptake levels, and vascular healing across paclitaxel, sirolimus, and everolimus platforms for both 510(k) and PMA submissions."

    "description": "Drug-eluting stents require validation beyond mechanical testing because the polymer coating must release drug at precise rates while staying intact during deployment. The drug needs to reach vessel walls at therapeutic levels that prevent restenosis without causing toxicity. This combination product challenge means we test both device mechanics and drug delivery together, validating how the coating performs during balloon expansion and how effectively the drug penetrates arterial tissue.\n\nWe track drug release using HPLC analysis that measures elution over time under flow conditions that match coronary arteries. Scanning electron microscopy shows coating uniformity across stent struts while tissue samples reveal drug concentration in vessel walls. Our testing captures how drugs like paclitaxel and sirolimus distribute through arterial layers, measuring the tissue levels that determine whether the stent prevents smooth muscle cell growth effectively.\n\nDrug-eluting stents follow FDA combination product rules requiring coordination between device and drug review centers. We conduct ISO 10993 biocompatibility testing adapted for drug-eluting systems while ISO 25539 guides mechanical validation. Our protocols address both 510(k) pathways comparing to predicate devices and PMA submissions for breakthrough technologies. Testing demonstrates that polymer coatings maintain drug stability through sterilization and shelf life while delivering therapeutic benefit during vascular healing.",
