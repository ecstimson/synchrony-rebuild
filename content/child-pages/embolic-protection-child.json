    "description": "Successful embolic protection requires devices that capture plaque debris without blocking blood flow to critical organs, contain all captured material during retrieval, and deploy reliably in the seconds available during high-risk procedures. We test particle capture efficiency down to 40 microns, measure flow obstruction at the filter, validate debris retention during device collapse and removal, and confirm deployment accuracy in tortuous anatomy."

    "description": "Embolic protection devices face competing demands that make preclinical testing critical. Your filter or occlusion system must catch particles that could cause stroke, heart attack, or organ damage, yet the same pores or mechanisms that capture debris also restrict blood flow to tissue that depends on continuous perfusion. Deploy too slowly and emboli escape before protection activates. Retrieve carelessly and captured debris spills back into circulation. The device must accomplish all this during procedures where seconds matter and anatomical access may be challenging through tortuous vessels or difficult angulations.\n\nWe test embolic protection devices using programmable debris generators that release controlled quantities of synthetic particles sized from 40 microns to 5 millimeters, replicating the size distribution of emboli generated during carotid stenting, TAVR, and peripheral interventions. High-speed imaging tracks what your filter captures versus what passes through, while flow sensors measure pressure gradients that indicate perfusion compromise. We validate that your device deploys within the time window available during actual procedures, test debris retention as the filter collapses for retrieval, and confirm that captured material remains contained during catheter withdrawal through guide catheters. Testing covers distal filter systems, proximal occlusion devices, and flow reversal systems across vessel diameters from 3mm to 8mm.\n\nOur protocols align with FDA guidance for embolic protection devices, typically following the 510(k) pathway with substantial equivalence to predicate devices. Testing demonstrates adequate particle capture for procedural safety, minimal flow obstruction during deployment, complete debris containment during retrieval, and reliable performance across relevant vascular territories. We measure capture efficiency against benchmarks established for cerebral protection during carotid stenting and peripheral intervention safety, while flow preservation data confirms tissue perfusion throughout the protected period.",
