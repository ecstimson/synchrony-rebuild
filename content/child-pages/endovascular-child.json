    "description": "Robotic endovascular platforms must deliver catheters and devices through vascular anatomy while protecting operators from radiation exposure, maintain precise control during complex interventions, and integrate seamlessly with imaging modalities. We test navigation accuracy in coronary and peripheral territories, measure radiation dose reduction for operators, validate remote manipulation precision, and confirm compatibility with angiography and intravascular imaging systems for both 510(k) and PMA submissions."

    "description": "Robotic endovascular intervention addresses a critical challenge in modern catheterization laboratories where operators receive cumulative radiation exposure during complex procedures. Your system must enable precise catheter manipulation from a shielded remote workstation while providing visualization and haptic feedback equivalent to tableside technique. The robot must navigate through coronary arteries during PCI, advance through peripheral vessels during complex limb salvage, and deliver large devices during structural heart procedures. All this occurs while the operator sits meters away from the patient, relying on robotic fidelity to sense vessel resistance and control device positioning.\n\nWe test robotic endovascular systems across vascular territories including coronary, peripheral, and visceral circulations. Navigation protocols measure positioning accuracy during simulated PCI through tortuous coronary anatomy and during peripheral interventions through long femoropopliteal segments. Radiation exposure assessment quantifies operator dose reduction achieved by remote workstation operation compared to tableside technique. Force feedback evaluation validates that operators can detect guidewire resistance, stent deployment forces, and balloon inflation through robotic interfaces. We test integration with angiography systems, IVUS platforms, and hemodynamic monitors while measuring setup efficiency and emergency protocol compatibility.\n\nISO 13485 quality management and IEC 60601 electrical safety standards guide robotic medical device development while radiation safety protocols address operator protection claims. Our testing supports 510(k) pathways for robotic catheter delivery systems and PMA submissions for integrated therapeutic platforms. Whether validating a coronary robotic PCI system or characterizing a peripheral intervention robot for complex femoropopliteal disease, our protocols address the navigation precision, radiation protection, force feedback, and procedural integration that endovascular robotics validation requires across multiple vascular territories.",
