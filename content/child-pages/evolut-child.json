    "description": "Self-expanding transcatheter aortic valves face unique validation challenges requiring controlled nitinol frame deployment mechanics, repositioning capability assessment across multiple deployment attempts, and supra-annular leaflet performance optimization that maximizes effective orifice area. Medtronic Evolut-type platforms must demonstrate predictable self-expansion behavior, secure retrieval and redeployment functionality enabling procedural optimization, and superior hemodynamic performance through enhanced valve design. Device success depends on achieving optimal radial force distribution preventing paravalvular leak while maintaining repositioning capabilities that enhance procedural safety and valve positioning accuracy.\n\nWe evaluate self-expansion mechanics using specialized delivery system assessment platforms quantifying nitinol frame deployment forces, expansion rates, and positioning control throughout complete deployment sequences. Our catheterization laboratories feature advanced fluoroscopic capabilities enabling three-dimensional visualization of valve positioning, repositioning mechanics documentation, and supra-annular leaflet function assessment during multiple deployment cycles. From nitinol framework characterization measuring chronic outward force to repositioning impact validation assessing performance after recapture-redeploy sequences, our protocols address the specific requirements self-expanding platforms present across varying aortic root anatomies.\n\nISO 5840 standards guide transcatheter heart valve device testing while FDA guidance documents for TAVR devices inform protocol development addressing repositioning safety, supra-annular design validation, and long-term durability requirements. Our GLP-compliant protocols support both PMA submissions for breakthrough repositionable valve technologies and 510(k) pathways demonstrating substantial equivalence to established Evolut platforms. Whether validating nitinol framework designs with porcine pericardial leaflets or novel repositioning mechanisms enhancing deployment control, our testing addresses regulatory expectations for Class III self-expanding transcatheter cardiac devices with enhanced procedural capabilities.",
