    "description": "Heart failure devices sustain life when cardiac function deteriorates, requiring validation that demonstrates both mechanical performance and therapeutic benefit. LVADs must maintain continuous flow across varying preload and afterload conditions while preventing hemolysis, platelet activation, and thrombotic complications. Cardiac resynchronization therapy devices need precise pacing algorithms that restore ventricular synchrony and improve ejection fraction. Temporary support systems require rapid deployment validation and stable performance during acute decompensation events.\n\nWe evaluate pump performance using pressure-volume loop analysis and real-time flow monitoring that captures hemodynamic responses across physiological stress conditions. Our catheterization laboratories feature continuous cardiac output measurement, ventricular pressure monitoring, and echocardiographic imaging that tracks device-heart interactions throughout complete cardiac cycles. Hemocompatibility testing quantifies hemolysis indices, platelet function, and von Willebrand factor degradation using ISO 10993-4 protocols adapted for rotary blood pump assessment.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide chronic implantation assessment while device-specific protocols address pump durability, electrical performance validation for CRT systems, and anatomical integration for surgical implants. Whether validating next-generation continuous-flow LVADs, percutaneous temporary support devices, or biventricular assist systems, our GLP-compliant testing addresses both PMA pathway requirements and post-market surveillance objectives.",
