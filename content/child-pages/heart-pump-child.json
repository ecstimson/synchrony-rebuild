    "description": "Mechanical circulatory support devices sustain life by generating continuous flow, requiring validation that demonstrates reliable pump performance while preventing blood damage and thrombotic complications. Heart pumps must maintain 5 liters per minute across varying preload and afterload conditions while operating continuously for months or years without mechanical failure. Continuous-flow platforms demand specialized shear stress assessment while pulsatile systems require complex timing validation and chamber pressurization characterization.\n\nWe evaluate pump performance using pressure-flow curve analysis and real-time hemodynamic monitoring that captures output stability across physiological stress conditions. Our catheterization laboratories feature mock circulation loops replicating normal and failing heart hemodynamics while specialized test fixtures accommodate both implantable and percutaneous pump configurations. Hemocompatibility protocols quantify hemolysis indices, platelet activation markers, and von Willebrand factor degradation using ISO 10993-4 adapted for high-shear blood pump environments.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide chronic implantation assessment while device-specific protocols address pump durability through accelerated fatigue testing, flow dynamics optimization, and anatomical integration studies. Our GLP-compliant testing addresses PMA pathway requirements for Class III life-sustaining devices. Whether validating next-generation LVADs, temporary support systems, or total artificial hearts, our protocols demonstrate both mechanical reliability and hemocompatibility performance that regulatory submissions demand.",
