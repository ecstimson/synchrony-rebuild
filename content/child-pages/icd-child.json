    "description": "Implantable cardioverter defibrillators prevent sudden cardiac death through rapid arrhythmia detection and high-voltage therapy delivery, requiring validation that demonstrates reliable detection algorithms while delivering effective defibrillation without unnecessary shocks. ICDs must discriminate life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias from benign rhythms while charging capacitors rapidly and delivering therapy that terminates fibrillation consistently. Transvenous systems demand comprehensive lead validation while subcutaneous platforms require alternative pathway characterization and CRT-D devices need biventricular pacing assessment alongside defibrillation capability.\n\nWe evaluate ICD performance using specialized electrophysiology systems that induce ventricular arrhythmias and assess detection accuracy with millisecond precision. Our high-voltage testing infrastructure characterizes defibrillation thresholds across energy levels while waveform optimization validates biphasic shock delivery effectiveness. Arrhythmia simulation capabilities test detection algorithms across varying ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation presentations while electromagnetic compatibility chambers assess device performance near MRI systems and medical equipment generating electromagnetic interference.\n\nISO 14708 series standards guide ICD assessment while FDA guidance documents for active implantable cardioverter defibrillators inform protocol development addressing defibrillation efficacy, sensing accuracy, and electromagnetic safety requirements. Our GLP-compliant testing supports PMA pathways for Class III life-sustaining devices. Whether validating traditional transvenous ICDs, subcutaneous systems avoiding intracardiac leads, or CRT-D platforms combining resynchronization and defibrillation therapy, our protocols demonstrate detection reliability, shock efficacy, and electromagnetic compatibility that sudden cardiac death prevention devices demand.",
