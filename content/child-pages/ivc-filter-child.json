    "description": "Inferior vena cava filters must trap life-threatening emboli while maintaining venous return, resist migration under high blood flow, and allow retrieval when temporary protection ends. We test clot capture efficiency across embolus sizes, measure flow obstruction and pressure gradients, validate caval wall fixation strength, and confirm retrieval success after extended implantation for both permanent and retrievable designs."

    "title": "Our Preclinical Expertise",
    "description": "IVC filters face competing demands that make preclinical validation critical. Your device must catch pulmonary emboli traveling toward the lungs while allowing normal venous blood flow to continue. Struts must engage the caval wall firmly enough to resist migration under high blood velocities yet gently enough to avoid perforation or significant wall injury. For retrievable designs, the device must maintain these performance characteristics while remaining removable after weeks or months of implantation when surrounding tissue has begun to encapsulate the filter structure.\n\nWe test IVC filters using large-diameter venous flow simulators that replicate inferior vena cava hemodynamics including flow rates up to 5 liters per minute. Standardized clot analogs ranging from small fibrin fragments to large organized thrombi evaluate capture efficiency while measuring what percentage of emboli the filter traps versus allowing passage. Flow sensors quantify pressure gradients across the device to detect significant flow obstruction while force measurement systems validate caval wall engagement strength. For retrievable filters, we simulate tissue encapsulation and measure extraction forces after accelerated aging protocols that predict long-term removal challenges.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide material evaluation for permanent IVC contact while device-specific protocols assess thrombogenicity on filter surfaces exposed to continuous blood flow. Our testing supports 510(k) pathways comparing to predicate devices and PMA submissions for novel filter geometries or retrieval mechanisms. Whether validating a permanent cone design or characterizing a retrievable filter with hook-based removal, our protocols address the clot trapping effectiveness, flow preservation, wall fixation, and retrieval success that determine clinical performance in pulmonary embolism prevention.",
