        "description": "Liquid embolic agents face unique validation challenges requiring controlled precipitation that achieves complete aneurysm or AVM occlusion while preventing non-target embolization into normal cerebral vessels. EVOH copolymer systems dissolved in DMSO must demonstrate predictable solidification kinetics when the solvent disperses into blood, forming casts that conform to complex vascular malformation geometries. Cyanoacrylate adhesives require polymerization timing optimization that allows adequate working time while achieving rapid vessel occlusion.\n\nWe evaluate embolic agent deliverability using microcatheter compatibility testing that characterizes injection force profiles, tip clogging resistance, and flow behavior through varying catheter lengths and diameters. Controlled flow circuits simulate cerebral blood flow conditions during agent delivery while measuring precipitation timing, fill completeness, and migration resistance. Our laboratories feature high-resolution fluoroscopy enabling real-time visualization of radiopaque agent distribution while specialized protocols assess DMSO-induced vasospasm potential and tantalum concentration effects on imaging visibility.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide embolic agent evaluation including cytotoxicity, sensitization, and chronic implantation response assessment. FDA guidance for liquid embolic devices informs protocol development addressing both AVM embolization and intracranial aneurysm treatment applications. Our GLP-compliant testing supports PMA pathways for novel embolic formulations and 510(k) submissions for agents demonstrating substantial equivalence to established platforms like Onyx and n-BCA systems.",
