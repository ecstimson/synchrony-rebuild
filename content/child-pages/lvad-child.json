    "description": "Left ventricular assist devices provide life-sustaining cardiac support, requiring validation that demonstrates pump reliability while preventing thrombosis, hemolysis, and infection complications throughout extended implantation periods. LVADs must maintain continuous flow supporting 5-6 liters per minute while preserving ventricular function and enabling potential cardiac recovery. Continuous-flow platforms demand specialized assessment of shear-induced blood damage while pump-ventricle interaction analysis ensures optimal hemodynamic support across varying cardiac function levels.\n\nWe evaluate LVAD performance using pressure-volume loop analysis and ventricular function monitoring that captures device-heart interaction throughout cardiac cycles. Our catheterization laboratories feature mock circulation systems replicating normal and failing heart conditions while specialized surgical models enable driveline tunneling assessment and percutaneous site evaluation. Hemocompatibility testing quantifies hemolysis indices, platelet activation, and von Willebrand factor degradation using ISO 10993-4 protocols adapted for chronic continuous-flow environments found in destination therapy applications.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide long-term implantation assessment while FDA guidance documents for ventricular assist devices inform protocol development addressing pump durability, electrical safety, and infection resistance requirements. Our GLP-compliant testing supports PMA pathways for Class III life-sustaining devices. Whether validating next-generation miniaturized LVADs, pediatric platforms, or destination therapy systems, our protocols demonstrate mechanical reliability, hemocompatibility performance, and driveline integrity that bridge-to-transplant and destination therapy indications demand.",
