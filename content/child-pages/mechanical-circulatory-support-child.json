    "description": "Mechanical circulatory support devices provide temporary or permanent cardiac assistance during acute decompensation, cardiogenic shock, or post-cardiotomy failure requiring validation that demonstrates rapid deployment capability while delivering hemodynamic augmentation across varying cardiac function levels. These platforms range from percutaneous microaxial pumps to surgically implanted biventricular assist systems, each demanding specialized assessment of flow augmentation, ventricular unloading, and end-organ perfusion maintenance. Temporary support devices must enable swift deployment through catheter-based or surgical access while biventricular platforms require coordinated left and right ventricular assistance preventing pulmonary congestion or systemic hypoperfusion.\n\nWe evaluate mechanical support performance using pressure-volume loop analysis and cardiac output measurement that captures hemodynamic improvement throughout support escalation and weaning protocols. Our catheterization laboratories feature acute heart failure models enabling percutaneous device deployment assessment while surgical facilities accommodate biventricular platform implantation and total artificial heart installation. Hemodynamic monitoring quantifies flow augmentation, ventricular pressure reduction, and end-organ perfusion markers across support levels while hemocompatibility testing addresses thrombogenicity throughout temporary support durations ranging from hours to weeks of continuous operation before recovery or bridge-to-decision transitions.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide material selection for blood-contacting surfaces while IEC 60601 electrical safety requirements address active device components including pumps, controllers, and power systems. FDA guidance for circulatory support devices informs protocol development addressing hemodynamic efficacy endpoints, weaning success criteria, and the safety evidence temporary platforms require for emergency use indications. Our GLP-compliant testing supports PMA pathways for Class III life-sustaining devices. Whether validating percutaneous microaxial pumps, extracorporeal centrifugal platforms, or biventricular assist systems, our protocols demonstrate hemodynamic support capacity, deployment reliability, and the hemocompatibility performance acute circulatory failure management demands.",
