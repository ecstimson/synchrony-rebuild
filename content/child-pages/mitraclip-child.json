    "title": "Our Preclinical Expertise",
    "description": "Edge-to-edge mitral repair devices face unique validation challenges requiring precise leaflet grasping mechanics across varying tissue pathologies, deployment accuracy within moving cardiac structures, and residual regurgitation optimization that preserves mitral valve area. MitraClip-type devices must demonstrate secure leaflet capture without tissue trauma, positioning precision that targets regurgitant jets, and clip closure mechanics that create effective double-orifice configurations. Device success depends on achieving significant mitral regurgitation reduction while avoiding mitral stenosis, requiring comprehensive assessment across both primary degenerative disease and secondary functional regurgitation.\n\nWe evaluate grasping force using specialized measurement systems that quantify clip closure pressure, leaflet compression characteristics, and tissue holding strength throughout cardiac cycles. Our catheterization laboratories feature transseptal access capabilities enabling realistic left atrial approach simulation while transesophageal echocardiography provides three-dimensional visualization of leaflet capture, clip positioning, and residual regurgitation patterns. From deployment accuracy validation in varying mitral anatomies to multi-clip strategy assessment, our protocols address the specific performance requirements each edge-to-edge repair platform presents.\n\nISO 5840 standards guide transcatheter heart valve device testing while FDA guidance documents for transcatheter mitral repair inform protocol development addressing hemodynamic benchmarks, procedural safety, and durability requirements. Our GLP-compliant protocols support both PMA submissions for breakthrough repair technologies and 510(k) pathways demonstrating substantial equivalence to established MitraClip platforms. Whether validating fourth-generation devices with independent gripper control or specialized systems addressing complex anatomies, our testing addresses regulatory expectations for Class III transcatheter mitral devices across primary and secondary mitral regurgitation applications.",
