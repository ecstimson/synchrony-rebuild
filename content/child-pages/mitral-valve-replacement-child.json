    "description": "Transcatheter mitral valve replacement systems face anatomical challenges that exceed aortic valve complexity, requiring secure anchoring within D-shaped annuli lacking the calcific foundation TAVR devices utilize while avoiding left ventricular outflow tract obstruction throughout valve positioning. TMVR platforms must demonstrate stable implantation across varying annular geometries, effective sealing preventing paravalvular regurgitation, and hemodynamic performance preserving cardiac output while specialized delivery systems navigate transseptal or transapical approaches. Success depends on annular anchoring preventing device migration, leaflet mechanics providing adequate orifice area, and durability throughout years of asymmetric loading across saddle-shaped anatomy.\n\nWe evaluate anchoring effectiveness using force measurement systems that quantify radial expansion characteristics, atrial and ventricular anchoring element engagement, and resistance to migration throughout cardiac cycles under physiological pressures. Our catheterization laboratories feature mitral annular models representing native valve, failed surgical valve, and failed repair anatomies while transesophageal echocardiography captures deployment accuracy and LVOT assessment throughout positioning. Hemodynamic protocols measure transvalvular gradients, effective orifice area, and atrial pressure changes while flow visualization identifies regions susceptible to thrombosis or pannus formation. Advanced computational modeling supplements testing by predicting LVOT obstruction risk across anatomical variations informing patient selection criteria development.\n\nISO 5840 standards for transcatheter heart valves guide testing protocols while FDA guidance documents for mitral valve replacement inform regulatory submission requirements addressing hemodynamic benchmarks, anchoring validation, and durability expectations. Our GLP-compliant testing supports PMA pathways for Class III devices across transseptal and transapical delivery approaches. Whether validating self-expanding nitinol frames, dual-anchoring systems, or novel sealing technologies, our protocols demonstrate anatomical compatibility, paravalvular leak prevention, and the hemodynamic performance TMVR platforms demand across native valve disease, failed surgical repair, and valve-in-valve applications.",
