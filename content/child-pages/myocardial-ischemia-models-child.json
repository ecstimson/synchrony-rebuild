    "description": "Myocardial ischemia models create reproducible heart failure states enabling device validation in standardized disease conditions that simulate clinical presentations from acute coronary syndrome to chronic ventricular dysfunction. These controlled ischemia protocols require precise coronary occlusion techniques producing consistent infarct sizes while hemodynamic monitoring captures the ventricular function deterioration, cardiac output reduction, and pressure-volume relationship changes that characterize progressive heart failure. Model development demands careful titration of ischemia severity creating mild, moderate, or severe dysfunction matching specific device testing requirements while maintaining subject viability throughout study durations enabling chronic device evaluation.\n\nWe develop ischemia models using controlled coronary artery ligation that produces reproducible left anterior descending, circumflex, or right coronary territory infarcts with infarct size quantification through TTC staining, cardiac MRI, and electrocardiographic ST-segment analysis. Our catheterization laboratories feature pressure-volume loop systems capturing ventricular function decline while echocardiography tracks wall motion abnormalities, ejection fraction deterioration, and chamber remodeling throughout acute and chronic phases. Biomarker measurement validates ischemic injury through troponin elevation and BNP increases while hemodynamic assessment documents the cardiac output reduction, filling pressure elevation, and compensatory mechanism activation that heart failure progression demonstrates across days to months following infarction.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide testing when devices are evaluated in these disease models while GLP compliance ensures reproducibility and data integrity throughout model development and device validation protocols. Our heart failure models support device testing across mechanical circulatory support, structural heart interventions, and cardiac rhythm management applications requiring standardized disease conditions. Whether developing acute ischemia protocols for hemodynamic support device validation, chronic remodeling models for ventricular restraint assessment, or titrated dysfunction states for device comparison studies, our methodologies create reproducible heart failure conditions enabling meaningful device performance evaluation and regulatory submission support.",
