    "description": "Robotic neurovascular systems must navigate tortuous cerebral anatomy with submillimeter precision, provide stable catheter manipulation during delicate procedures, and maintain force feedback through multiple degrees of freedom. We test navigation accuracy through Circle of Willis models, measure tremor elimination during microcatheter positioning, validate force transmission fidelity, and confirm electromagnetic compatibility with neuroimaging systems for both 510(k) and PMA pathways."

    "description": "Robotic neurovascular intervention presents unique challenges that distinguish it from other robotic surgery applications. Your system must guide catheters through 2-5mm intracranial vessels with extreme tortuosity including carotid siphon configurations and Circle of Willis anatomy where human hand tremor proves limiting. The robot must provide haptic feedback sensitive enough to detect vessel wall contact in delicate cerebral arteries yet robust enough to transmit forces through long catheter systems. All components must function within magnetic fields during concurrent imaging without causing artifact or safety hazards during procedures that may span hours.\n\nWe test robotic neurovascular systems using anatomically accurate cerebral vessel models that replicate the tortuous anatomy from femoral access through intracranial target sites. Navigation accuracy protocols measure positioning precision to submillimeter tolerances while force measurement systems validate haptic feedback fidelity through catheter lengths exceeding 100cm. Tremor elimination assessment quantifies how effectively your robotic system stabilizes microcatheter manipulation compared to manual technique. We evaluate electromagnetic compatibility with fluoroscopy and CT systems, test catheter tracking accuracy during simulated thrombectomy or aneurysm coiling, and measure the system's ability to maintain stable position during contrast injection or device deployment.\n\nISO 13485 quality management standards guide medical device development while IEC 60601 electrical safety requirements address robotic system components. Our testing supports 510(k) pathways for robotic catheter positioning systems and PMA submissions for integrated therapeutic platforms. Whether validating a teleoperated catheter robot for stroke intervention or characterizing an autonomous navigation system for aneurysm treatment, our protocols address the navigation precision, force feedback, electromagnetic compatibility, and procedural integration that neurovascular robotics validation requires.",
