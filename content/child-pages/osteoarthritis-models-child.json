    "description": "Osteoarthritis disease models must replicate key pathological features including progressive cartilage degeneration, subchondral bone remodeling, synovial inflammation, and functional impairment that therapeutic interventions address. Surgical induction models using anterior cruciate ligament transection with partial medial meniscectomy create post-traumatic osteoarthritis replicating joint instability and altered biomechanics driving disease progression. Chemical induction using monosodium iodoacetate produces controlled cartilage degradation enabling dose-response assessment and standardized disease severity characterization. Spontaneous degeneration models replicate age-related osteoarthritis progression while genetic models address specific pathogenic mechanisms. Each model type serves different validation requirements from viscosupplementation effectiveness to disease-modifying drug assessment and regenerative therapy evaluation.\n\nWe characterize disease progression using modified Mankin scoring systems that quantify cartilage structural deterioration, proteoglycan loss, and chondrocyte abnormalities through histopathological examination. Joint imaging protocols including micro-computed tomography measure subchondral bone density changes, osteophyte formation, and joint space narrowing quantifying structural disease progression. Pain assessment utilizes validated behavioral scoring systems measuring weight-bearing asymmetry, voluntary activity changes, and response to mechanical stimulation characterizing functional impairment. Our capabilities include gait analysis documenting altered biomechanics, biomarker measurement tracking cartilage degradation products, and synovial fluid analysis characterizing inflammatory mediators. Therapeutic intervention protocols evaluate treatment timing effects, dose-response relationships, and mechanism of action validation supporting investigational new drug applications.\n\nGood Laboratory Practice compliance ensures regulatory acceptance while FDA osteoarthritis guidance informs endpoint selection and study design addressing both structural modification demonstration and symptomatic benefit assessment requirements. Testing supports investigational device exemption applications for intra-articular devices and investigational new drug submissions for disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug candidates requiring preclinical efficacy demonstration. Whether validating viscosupplementation products, characterizing cartilage repair scaffold integration, or assessing anti-inflammatory drug effectiveness, our protocols generate data meeting osteoarthritis therapeutic regulatory expectations across both symptom management and structure modification endpoints.",
