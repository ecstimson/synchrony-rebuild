    "description": "Cardiac pacemakers sustain life through reliable electrical stimulation, requiring validation that demonstrates consistent sensing, appropriate pacing, and battery longevity across varying physiological conditions. Pacemakers must detect intrinsic cardiac activity while delivering therapy that maintains adequate heart rate without depleting battery reserves prematurely. Single-chamber systems demand precise ventricular pacing validation while dual-chamber platforms require complex atrial-ventricular synchronization assessment and rate-responsive devices need sensor algorithm verification across activity levels.\n\nWe evaluate electrical performance using specialized electrophysiology systems that capture pacing thresholds, sensing amplitudes, and impedance measurements with microsecond precision. Our catheterization laboratories feature programmable cardiac simulation systems enabling comprehensive pacing mode assessment and rate adaptation testing. Lead system testing evaluates conductor durability through accelerated fatigue protocols while biocompatibility assessment addresses chronic tissue contact requirements using ISO 10993 standards adapted for active implantable devices.\n\nISO 14708 series standards guide cardiac pacemaker assessment while FDA guidance documents for active implantable medical devices inform protocol development addressing electromagnetic compatibility, battery performance, and MRI conditional validation. Our GLP-compliant testing supports both 510(k) pathways demonstrating substantial equivalence and PMA submissions for breakthrough technologies. Whether validating traditional dual-chamber systems, leadless pacemaker platforms, or MRI-conditional devices, our protocols demonstrate electrical reliability, sensing accuracy, and long-term biocompatibility performance that regulatory submissions demand.",
