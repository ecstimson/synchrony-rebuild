    "description": "Transcatheter mitral repair devices with spacer technology face unique validation challenges requiring independent leaflet grasping mechanics assessment, spacer deployment characterization, and enhanced coaptation surface validation that differentiates Pascal-type systems from first-generation clip platforms. Edwards Pascal devices must demonstrate reliable independent gripper control enabling sequential leaflet capture, spacer expansion providing optimal tissue bridge formation, and broad paddle design creating superior coaptation compared to conventional edge-to-edge repair. Device success depends on validating spacer safety through tissue interaction studies while demonstrating enhanced repair effectiveness across challenging mitral anatomies including large flail segments and complex regurgitation patterns.\n\nWe evaluate independent grasping mechanics using specialized force measurement systems quantifying individual gripper closure pressure, leaflet compression characteristics per gripper, and optimal grasping sequence timing throughout deployment. Our catheterization laboratories feature three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography providing real-time spacer visualization, independent leaflet capture confirmation, and broad paddle coaptation assessment during complete deployment cycles. From spacer expansion validation measuring controlled deployment forces to multi-device strategy assessment evaluating optimal spacing configurations, our protocols address the specific performance requirements next-generation mitral repair platforms present across both primary and secondary regurgitation etiologies.\n\nISO 5840 standards guide transcatheter heart valve device testing while FDA guidance documents for transcatheter mitral repair inform protocol development addressing spacer technology safety, independent grasping validation, and comparative effectiveness requirements. Our GLP-compliant protocols support both PMA submissions for innovative repair technologies and 510(k) pathways demonstrating substantial equivalence where applicable. Whether validating spacer biocompatibility through chronic tissue response studies or characterizing enhanced repair capabilities through comparative effectiveness protocols, our testing addresses regulatory expectations for Class III transcatheter mitral devices with advanced design features requiring comprehensive safety and performance validation.",
