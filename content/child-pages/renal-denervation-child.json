    "description": "Renal denervation devices treat resistant hypertension by disrupting sympathetic nerves surrounding renal arteries. These catheter-based systems must prove they can achieve complete nerve ablation while preserving renal artery integrity and kidney function. Whether using radiofrequency energy or ultrasound, devices need validation showing sustained blood pressure reduction without nerve regrowth over time.\n\nWe test nerve ablation effectiveness through specialized immunohistochemistry that visualizes sympathetic fiber destruction, measuring norepinephrine levels to confirm functional denervation, and tracking blood pressure changes that demonstrate therapeutic benefit. Our protocols evaluate energy delivery consistency across varying vessel anatomies, ensuring circumferential ablation without creating arterial injury. From acute safety assessment through extended reinnervation studies, our testing addresses the complete validation path these hypertension devices require.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide chronic arterial contact assessment while FDA guidance for neurological devices informs ablation validation protocols. Our testing supports both early feasibility studies under IDE applications and comprehensive PMA submissions. Whether validating radiofrequency catheter designs or ultrasound transducer arrays, our protocols demonstrate the ablation completeness and renal safety FDA expects for hypertension treatment devices.",
