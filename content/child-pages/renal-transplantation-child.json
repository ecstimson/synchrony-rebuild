    "description": "Renal preservation technologies must maintain organ viability throughout transport durations while preserving functional capacity that determines transplantation success rates. Hypothermic machine perfusion systems require continuous monitoring of perfusion pressure, flow rates, and vascular resistance patterns throughout storage periods. Normothermic platforms demand metabolic support validation showing ATP preservation and cellular injury minimization across extended preservation timeframes. Each preservation strategy addresses different ischemia-reperfusion injury mechanisms requiring validated assessment protocols that predict post-transplantation outcomes.\n\nWe evaluate preservation system performance through continuous perfusion parameter monitoring that captures pressure-flow relationships, vascular resistance changes, and metabolic marker trends throughout storage periods matching clinical transport durations. Biochemical analysis tracks lactate dehydrogenase release indicating cellular damage while ATP quantification measures energy preservation determining functional recovery potential. Creatinine clearance assessment following reperfusion validates glomerular filtration capacity while urine output monitoring demonstrates tubular function restoration. Our protocols assess both immediate graft function and delayed graft function prevention across varying preservation conditions and donor quality scenarios.\n\nISO 13485 quality management system requirements guide organ preservation device development while FDA transplantation device guidance addresses effectiveness demonstration and safety validation requirements. Testing supports both 510(k) pathways for devices demonstrating substantial equivalence to cleared preservation systems and PMA submissions for breakthrough preservation technologies requiring comprehensive effectiveness validation. Whether characterizing hypothermic machine perfusion platforms, validating normothermic preservation effectiveness, or optimizing static cold storage conditions, our protocols generate data addressing transplantation technology regulatory expectations and clinical outcome prediction.",
