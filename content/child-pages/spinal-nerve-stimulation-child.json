    "description": "Spinal cord stimulation systems must demonstrate electrode array positioning accuracy achieving therapeutic neural recruitment while preventing complications including lead migration, epidural fibrosis, and device-related neurological injury. Percutaneous leads require insertion technique validation through interlaminar or transforaminal approaches while paddle arrays need laminotomy placement protocols ensuring stable positioning across spinal segments. Stimulation waveform characterization validates conventional tonic patterns, burst stimulation sequences, and high-frequency protocols demonstrating pain modulation effectiveness. Electrode configuration optimization requires impedance measurement across multiple contact combinations while current distribution mapping ensures therapeutic coverage without off-target effects. Power system validation addresses implantable pulse generator battery longevity and recharging system performance throughout projected device lifetime.\n\nWe evaluate lead placement using fluoroscopic guidance documenting epidural space navigation and electrode positioning relative to target spinal segments while electrophysiological monitoring measures stimulation threshold parameters and neural recruitment characteristics. Chronic implantation studies assess tissue response at electrode-tissue interfaces through histopathological examination characterizing fibrous encapsulation thickness, inflammatory cell infiltration patterns, and epidural tissue remodeling. Our protocols measure impedance stability throughout extended implantation periods while stimulation parameter titration validates paresthesia coverage mapping and therapeutic window characterization. Electrode array mechanical testing evaluates flexural fatigue resistance, kink resistance during spinal motion, and connection integrity under repeated flexion-extension cycles. We characterize electromagnetic compatibility ensuring device function across environmental conditions including magnetic resonance imaging safety assessment per ASTM active implant standards.\n\nISO 14708 active implantable medical device standards guide design validation while IEC 60601 medical electrical equipment requirements address electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility demonstration. FDA neuromodulation device guidance informs protocol development for both initial implant safety validation and long-term chronic stimulation effectiveness assessment. Testing supports PMA pathways for Class III neuromodulation technologies requiring comprehensive safety and effectiveness demonstration. Whether characterizing percutaneous lead migration resistance, validating paddle array anatomical coverage, or assessing closed-loop stimulation system responsiveness, our protocols generate data meeting spinal cord stimulation regulatory expectations for chronic pain management and emerging neurological disorder treatment applications.",
