    "description": "Stone fragmentation devices must demonstrate effective urolithiasis treatment across varying stone composition and size characteristics while proving tissue safety throughout repeated treatment applications. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy requires focal zone positioning accuracy validation ensuring energy delivery concentrates at stone locations without damaging surrounding structures. Laser lithotripsy platforms need fiber delivery system characterization showing consistent energy transmission throughout ureteroscopic procedures. Ultrasonic fragmentation devices demand probe contact efficiency assessment measuring vibration transmission that disintegrates stones while preserving urothelial tissue integrity. Each modality addresses different stone composition challenges requiring validated effectiveness protocols.\n\nWe evaluate lithotripsy performance through standardized synthetic stone models replicating calcium oxalate, uric acid, cystine, and struvite composition hardness characteristics encountered clinically while measuring fragmentation efficiency, particle size distribution, and complete clearance capability. Energy delivery characterization uses dosimetry measurement documenting shock wave pressure amplitudes, laser pulse energies, and ultrasonic power levels throughout treatment sequences. High-speed imaging captures fragmentation mechanisms and particle trajectory patterns while tissue effect protocols assess thermal injury potential, mechanical trauma extent, and urothelial preservation. Advanced imaging modalities track stone localization accuracy and treatment progression throughout procedures.\n\nIEC 61846 shock wave lithotripters safety standard guides extracorporeal system validation while device-specific protocols address laser safety per IEC 60825 and ultrasonic energy characterization requirements. Testing supports 510(k) pathways for devices demonstrating substantial equivalence to cleared lithotripsy platforms and addresses comprehensive safety validation for breakthrough fragmentation technologies. Whether characterizing extracorporeal shock wave systems, validating holmium laser lithotripsy effectiveness, or assessing ultrasonic probe fragmentation efficiency, our protocols generate data meeting urological stone management device regulatory expectations.",
