    "description": "Structural heart devices operate in anatomical environments where standard cardiovascular testing protocols fall short. LAA closure systems must seal appendages with chicken wing, cactus, cauliflower, and windsock morphologies while preventing peridevice leaks that compromise stroke protection. Septal defect occluders need stable positioning across varying defect geometries with tissue integration that creates permanent closure. Transcatheter repair platforms require precise deployment in moving cardiac structures while maintaining device stability throughout continuous cardiac cycles.\n\nWe evaluate deployment accuracy using high-resolution fluoroscopy and transesophageal echocardiography that captures device positioning throughout complete cardiac motion. Our catheterization laboratories feature specialized left atrial access capabilities, anatomical models representing morphological variations, and hemodynamic monitoring systems that assess device performance under physiological conditions. From device-tissue interface characterization to chronic endothelialization studies, our protocols address the specific challenges structural heart technologies present.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide chronic implantation assessment while device-specific protocols address deployment mechanics, anatomical compatibility across patient populations, and long-term tissue integration. Whether validating Watchman LAA occluders refined through dozens of studies, novel septal closure systems, or emerging transcatheter repair platforms, our GLP-compliant testing addresses both PMA pathway requirements and post-market surveillance objectives across structural heart device categories.",
