    "description": "Transcatheter aortic valve replacement systems face unique validation challenges requiring deployment precision across varying anatomies, paravalvular leak prevention in heavily calcified annuli, and coronary flow preservation throughout valve positioning. TAVR devices must demonstrate effective hemodynamic performance while avoiding conduction system interference that leads to permanent pacemaker implantation. Balloon-expandable platforms demand precise positioning validation while self-expanding systems require repositioning mechanics assessment and chronic radial force characterization.\n\nWe evaluate deployment accuracy using high-resolution fluoroscopy and transesophageal echocardiography that capture valve expansion, annular contact, and positioning stability throughout cardiac cycles. Our catheterization laboratories feature aortic root models spanning small annuli to severely calcified bicuspid valves while pulse duplicator systems quantify transvalvular gradients and effective orifice area under physiological flow conditions. Specialized protocols assess coronary ostia clearance, conduction bundle proximity, and paravalvular sealing effectiveness across anatomical variations that challenge standard TAVR approaches.\n\nISO 5840 standards guide transcatheter heart valve testing while FDA guidance documents for TAVR devices inform protocol development addressing hemodynamic benchmarks and durability requirements. Our GLP-compliant protocols support both PMA submissions for breakthrough valve technologies and 510(k) pathways for devices demonstrating substantial equivalence to established platforms. Whether validating standard TAVR systems or specialized applications including valve-in-valve procedures and bicuspid aortic valve treatment, our testing addresses regulatory expectations for Class III transcatheter cardiac devices.",
