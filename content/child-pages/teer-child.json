    "title": "Our Preclinical Expertise",
    "description": "Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair devices face unique validation challenges requiring precise leaflet grasping mechanics across varying tissue pathologies, deployment accuracy within moving cardiac structures, and residual regurgitation optimization that preserves valve area. TEER platforms must demonstrate secure leaflet capture without tissue trauma, positioning precision that targets regurgitant jets, and clip closure mechanics that create effective double-orifice configurations. Device success depends on achieving significant regurgitation reduction while avoiding stenosis, requiring comprehensive assessment across both primary degenerative disease and secondary functional regurgitation in mitral and tricuspid positions.\n\nWe evaluate grasping force using specialized measurement systems that quantify clip closure pressure, leaflet compression characteristics, and tissue holding strength throughout cardiac cycles. Our catheterization laboratories feature transseptal access capabilities enabling realistic left atrial approach simulation while transesophageal echocardiography provides three-dimensional visualization of leaflet capture, clip positioning, and residual regurgitation patterns. Advanced protocols assess independent gripper control systems, evaluate multi-clip deployment strategies, and characterize clip width selection for broad regurgitant jets while tricuspid-specific testing addresses unique anatomical considerations including annular dilation and leaflet tethering patterns.\n\nISO 5840 standards guide transcatheter heart valve device testing while FDA guidance documents for transcatheter mitral and tricuspid repair inform protocol development addressing hemodynamic benchmarks, procedural safety, and durability requirements. Our GLP-compliant protocols support both PMA submissions for breakthrough repair technologies and 510(k) pathways demonstrating substantial equivalence to established platforms. Whether validating fourth-generation devices with independent gripper control, specialized systems addressing complex anatomies, or tricuspid-specific TEER platforms, our testing addresses regulatory expectations for Class III transcatheter valve repair devices across primary and secondary regurgitation applications.",
