    "description": "Robotic thoracic surgery platforms must enable precise dissection in confined pleural spaces, provide stable retraction during lung resection, and accommodate single-lung ventilation dynamics without compromising visualization. We test instrument reach in intercostal access, measure force control during mediastinal dissection, validate camera stability during ventilation changes, and confirm visualization through blood and irrigation for both 510(k) and PMA pathways."

    "description": "Robotic thoracic surgery presents unique challenges that distinguish it from abdominal robotics applications. Your platform must operate in the confined space between ribs where instrument triangulation proves more difficult than abdominal access. The system must maintain visualization and instrument control while the operative lung deflates and re-inflates during single-lung ventilation. Instruments must provide the delicate force control necessary for mediastinal lymph node dissection and pulmonary vessel isolation while having sufficient strength for rib retraction and chest wall manipulation. The camera must deliver clear visualization through blood and irrigation in a confined space with limited ability to reposition for optimal viewing angles.\n\nWe test robotic thoracic surgery platforms using anatomically accurate chest models that replicate intercostal spacing, mediastinal anatomy, and pulmonary hilum configurations. Instrument reach assessment measures workspace coverage from standard port positions, evaluating whether articulating instruments access all areas of the pleural cavity including the apex and posterior costophrenic sulcus. Visualization testing validates camera performance during simulated single-lung ventilation with dynamic changes in operative field exposure. Force control protocols measure the delicate manipulation required for mediastinal dissection and vascular isolation. We evaluate setup considerations including port placement strategies, emergency conversion protocols, and compatibility with standard thoracic surgical equipment.\n\nISO 13485 quality management and IEC 60601 electrical safety standards guide robotic surgical device development while thoracic-specific protocols address the confined workspace and ventilation dynamics unique to chest procedures. Our testing supports 510(k) pathways for robotic platforms adapted from abdominal surgery and PMA submissions for thoracic-specific robotic systems. Whether validating a multi-port platform for robotic lobectomy or characterizing a thoracoscopic robot for mediastinal procedures, our protocols address the intercostal access constraints, visualization challenges, and precise force control that thoracic surgical robotics validation requires.",
