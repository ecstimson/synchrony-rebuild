    "title": "Our Preclinical Expertise",
    "description": "Mechanical thrombectomy devices must demonstrate effective clot engagement and retrieval while navigating tortuous cerebrovascular anatomy without damaging fragile vessel walls. Stent retrievers require validation of expansion dynamics that capture thrombus material while preventing distal embolization from clot fragmentation. Device tracking through internal carotid siphon tortuosity and middle cerebral artery angulation demands pushability and flexibility characterization across representative anatomical geometries.\n\nWe evaluate thrombectomy performance using anatomically accurate cerebrovascular phantoms replicating circle of Willis geometry while standardized synthetic clot formulations representing acute ischemic stroke thrombi enable reproducible testing. Our catheterization laboratories feature high-resolution biplane fluoroscopy and flow circuits simulating cerebral hemodynamics that capture clot-device interaction dynamics. Specialized protocols quantify first-pass recanalization rates, retrieval force optimization, and embolic fragment generation using downstream particle capture systems.\n\nFDA guidance for neurothrombectomy devices requires both bench testing demonstrating mechanical performance and animal studies evaluating vessel wall safety. ISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide blood-contacting component assessment while device-specific protocols address navigation through representative cerebrovascular tortuosity. Our GLP-compliant testing supports 510(k) pathways under product code POL and NRY classifications. Whether validating next-generation stent retrievers or combined aspiration-retrieval platforms, our protocols generate data addressing FDA expectations for Class II neurovascular mechanical thrombectomy devices.",
