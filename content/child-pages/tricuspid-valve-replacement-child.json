    "description": "Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement systems address unique anatomical challenges including extreme annular dilation, complex three-dimensional geometry, and pacemaker lead presence while operating in low-pressure right heart environments requiring specialized validation approaches. TTVR platforms must demonstrate secure anchoring within severely dilated annuli lacking structural support while accommodating existing pacemaker leads without interference, preventing paravalvular regurgitation across asymmetric annular shapes, and maintaining hemodynamic performance under venous pressures substantially lower than left heart conditions. Device success depends on anchoring preventing migration in thin-walled right atrium, sealing effectiveness across elliptical annular geometry, and durability throughout chronic volume overload.\n\nWe evaluate anchoring mechanisms using models representing severe tricuspid regurgitation with annular diameters exceeding 50mm, assessing radial force requirements and atrial wall interaction throughout cardiac cycles. Our catheterization laboratories feature pacemaker lead presence simulation enabling interference assessment during deployment and chronic implantation while transesophageal echocardiography captures valve positioning relative to right coronary artery, conduction system, and lead trajectories. Hemodynamic protocols adapted for low right-sided pressures measure transvalvular gradients under varying cardiac outputs while flow assessment quantifies regurgitation reduction and evaluates hepatic vein flow pattern normalization. Chronic studies assess leaflet function preservation, anchoring stability, and lead-device interaction throughout extended follow-up periods.\n\nISO 5840 standards for transcatheter heart valves guide protocol development while FDA guidance documents for structural heart devices inform submission requirements addressing the unique regulatory considerations tricuspid replacement presents. Our GLP-compliant testing supports PMA pathways for Class III devices across transfemoral, transjugular, and transatrial delivery approaches. Whether validating self-expanding frames designed for extreme annular dilation, dual-stage anchoring preventing migration, or specialized designs accommodating multiple pacemaker leads, our protocols demonstrate anatomical compatibility, hemodynamic adequacy, and the safety evidence TTVR platforms demand for severe tricuspid regurgitation applications.",
