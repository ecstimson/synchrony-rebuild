    "description": "Watchman devices represent the established standard for percutaneous LAA closure, requiring validation that addresses nitinol framework expansion, polyester fabric membrane sealing, and sizing accuracy across diverse appendage geometries. These self-expanding occluders must demonstrate controlled deployment, adequate wall apposition force, and complete appendage isolation while supporting endothelialization that prevents thrombus formation. Success depends on validating framework durability under cardiac loading, membrane integrity throughout device lifetime, and optimal sizing across the spectrum of LAA anatomical variations.\n\nWe evaluate framework performance using specialized expansion testing that quantifies radial force, shape memory recovery, and deployment consistency across temperature ranges. Our catheterization laboratories feature transesophageal echocardiography capabilities, anatomical models representing chicken wing through windsock morphologies, and flow measurement systems that assess sealing effectiveness. From nitinol fatigue characterization to fabric endothelialization studies, our protocols address the specific validation requirements Watchman platforms demand.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide nitinol and fabric material assessment while device specific protocols address compression ratio optimization and anchoring stability validation. Our GLP compliant testing supports both 510(k) pathways for devices demonstrating substantial equivalence to established Watchman predicates and PMA submissions for significant design modifications. Whether validating next generation framework designs or novel fabric configurations, our protocols address FDA expectations for LAA closure devices across intended patient populations.",
