We evaluate continuous-flow performance using pressure-volume loop analysis and ventricular function monitoring that captures device-heart interaction throughout cardiac cycles. Mock circulation systems replicate failing heart conditions while hemocompatibility protocols quantify hemolysis indices, platelet activation, and von Willebrand factor degradation using ISO 10993-4 adapted for rotary blood pumps. Our GLP-compliant protocols support PMA pathways for Class III life-sustaining devices across bridge-to-transplant and destination therapy applications.",

Pulse duplicator systems measure hemodynamic performance against ISO 5840 standards while accelerated durability protocols simulate 200-400 million cycles. Whether validating balloon-expandable or self-expanding platforms, our protocols address both PMA requirements for breakthrough technologies and 510(k) pathways demonstrating substantial equivalence to established predicates.",
