We develop osteoarthritis models using standardized surgical induction methods that replicate key disease features including cartilage fibrillation, proteoglycan loss, and inflammatory synovial changes. Our assessment protocols include modified Mankin scoring for cartilage degeneration quantification, pain behavior evaluation through validated scoring systems, and imaging biomarkers tracking disease progression. From viscosupplementation effectiveness to cartilage repair scaffold integration, our testing addresses both 510(k) pathways for osteoarthritis treatment devices and investigational protocols supporting clinical trial design for regenerative therapies requiring comprehensive disease model characterization and therapeutic outcome validation.",

We evaluate fracture fixation performance using standardized defect models that replicate critical-size bone gaps requiring intervention for healing completion. Our protocols assess device mechanical stability through biomechanical testing per ASTM F1717 spinal implant standards adapted for long bone applications while bone formation quantification utilizes microCT volumetric analysis, histomorphometry measuring new bone area, and biomechanical testing of healed constructs. From metallic fixation plates to bioresorbable scaffolds and bone graft substitutes, our testing addresses both 510(k) pathways demonstrating substantial equivalence and PMA requirements for novel osteogenic technologies requiring comprehensive effectiveness demonstration supporting regulatory submissions.",

We conduct biomechanical testing following ASTM standards specific to device applications including compression testing per ASTM F1717, fatigue protocols simulating millions of load cycles, and torsional strength assessment. Material characterization evaluates modulus matching between implants and native bone preventing stress shielding while finite element analysis validates stress distribution patterns. Our testing capabilities span from spinal fixation hardware requiring multi-axial loading protocols to joint replacement components demanding wear testing per ISO 14242 standards. Advanced imaging including microCT enables three-dimensional reconstruction and quantitative morphometry while mechanical testing of explanted devices validates long-term performance predictions supporting regulatory pathways requiring comprehensive durability demonstration.",
