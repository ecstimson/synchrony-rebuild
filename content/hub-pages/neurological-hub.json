        "description": "Cerebrospinal fluid shunt systems face unique challenges proving drainage effectiveness while preventing complications including valve malfunction, catheter obstruction, and infection risks. We evaluate shunt performance using validated hydrocephalus models that replicate elevated intracranial pressure and altered CSF dynamics requiring device intervention. Our protocols assess valve opening pressure accuracy, flow rate regulation across physiological pressure ranges, and catheter patency under chronic implantation conditions. From fixed pressure valves to programmable systems with adjustable settings, our testing addresses both 510(k) pathways demonstrating substantial equivalence to predicate shunts and PMA requirements for breakthrough technologies incorporating novel pressure regulation mechanisms requiring comprehensive safety demonstration supporting clinical applications across pediatric and adult hydrocephalus populations.",

We evaluate sealant performance using standardized burst pressure protocols that measure seal integrity under physiological stress conditions while tissue response studies assess biocompatibility at dural interfaces and neural tissue. Leak detection methods quantify sealing effectiveness immediately following craniotomy closure and throughout healing phases addressing both acute and chronic performance requirements. Our GLP-compliant protocols support regulatory submissions across fibrin-based, polyethylene glycol, and biological sealant platforms requiring ISO 10993 biocompatibility demonstration with additional neurotoxicity assessment per FDA neurological device guidance for dural closure applications across cranial and spinal surgical procedures.",

We test stimulator lead placement using fluoroscopic guidance documenting epidural space navigation and electrode positioning relative to target spinal segments. Electrophysiological monitoring measures stimulation threshold parameters, current distribution patterns, and neural recruitment characteristics while chronic implantation studies assess tissue response at electrode-tissue interfaces. Our protocols evaluate both conventional tonic stimulation and burst waveform patterns across multiple electrode configurations supporting regulatory pathways for neuromodulation technologies. From paddle arrays to percutaneous leads, our testing addresses PMA requirements for Class III active implantable devices requiring comprehensive effectiveness and safety demonstration per IEC 60601 medical electrical equipment standards.",
