        "description": "COPD interventions reducing lung volume face unique challenges proving therapeutic benefit while ensuring bronchoscopic deployment safety in diseased airways. We evaluate endobronchial valve performance using validated emphysema models that replicate hyperinflation and collateral ventilation characteristics determining device effectiveness. Our protocols assess valve deployment accuracy under fluoroscopic guidance, sealing integrity preventing air passage to isolated lobes, and pulmonary function changes through spirometry and plethysmography measurements. From one-way valve mechanisms to coil-based volume reduction platforms, our testing addresses both 510(k) pathways demonstrating substantial equivalence and PMA requirements for breakthrough COPD technologies requiring comprehensive effectiveness demonstration supporting clinical trial initiation.",

        "description": "Lung sealants preventing prolonged air leaks following pulmonary resection must demonstrate adhesion strength sufficient to withstand respiratory pressures while supporting pleural healing without inflammatory complications. We evaluate sealant performance using standardized air leak quantification protocols that measure seal integrity under physiological ventilation pressures while tissue response studies assess healing quality at pleural surfaces. Burst pressure testing validates acute sealing effectiveness while chronic implantation studies track sealant degradation, inflammatory response, and tissue integration throughout healing phases. Our GLP-compliant protocols support regulatory submissions across synthetic adhesives, fibrin-based sealants, and hydrogel platforms requiring ISO 10993 biocompatibility demonstration alongside mechanical performance validation per ASTM surgical sealant standards for thoracic applications.",
