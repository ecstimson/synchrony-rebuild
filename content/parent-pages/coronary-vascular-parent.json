    "title": "What We Test",
    "description": "Coronary vascular devices restore myocardial perfusion through mechanical scaffolding and pharmacological intervention, requiring validation that demonstrates antirestenotic efficacy while promoting vascular healing. Drug-eluting stents face complexity as combination products requiring integrated assessment of mechanical performance, polymer coating stability, and antiproliferative drug activity. Drug-coated balloons demand characterization of rapid drug transfer kinetics during brief inflation periods while minimizing systemic exposure. Both platform types must achieve therapeutic tissue concentrations in coronary arterial walls while supporting complete endothelialization. Each technology presents unique regulatory challenges from CDRH-CDER coordination for combination products to demonstrating superiority over established bare metal and first-generation drug-eluting platforms.\n\nWe evaluate mechanical integrity through radial force measurement, recoil assessment, and deployment characterization in anatomically accurate coronary models featuring LAD, RCA, and circumflex vessel geometries. Our analytical laboratories feature HPLC systems quantifying drug release kinetics, tissue uptake mapping therapeutic agent distribution in arterial walls, and polymer degradation assessment tracking coating changes throughout shelf life and implantation. Specialized protocols characterize drug transfer efficiency during balloon inflation, measuring coating adhesion, particle loss during tracking, and rapid tissue penetration. Vascular healing assessment employs standardized histomorphometry measuring neointimal thickness progression, strut coverage timepoints, and inflammatory response scoring.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide material and polymer evaluation while ISO 25539 specifications inform mechanical testing for vascular stents. Combination product requirements demand CDRH-CDER coordination addressing drug-specific toxicology, release kinetics, and tissue distribution. Our GLP-compliant testing supports both 510(k) substantial equivalence demonstrations and PMA pathways for novel therapeutic combinations. Whether validating established drug-eluting stent platforms, next-generation bioresorbable scaffolds, or novel drug-coated balloon formulations, our protocols demonstrate mechanical performance, pharmacological efficacy, and vascular healing that coronary intervention indications demand.",
