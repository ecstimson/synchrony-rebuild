    "title": "What We Test",
    "description": "Mechanical circulatory support devices sustain life when cardiac function deteriorates, requiring validation that demonstrates pump reliability while preventing thrombosis, hemolysis, and infection complications throughout extended implantation periods. LVADs must maintain continuous flow supporting 5-6 liters per minute across varying preload and afterload conditions while preserving potential for myocardial recovery. Temporary support systems demand rapid deployment validation and stable performance during acute decompensation events. Each platform category presents unique challenges from driveline infection resistance in chronic LVADs to gas exchange efficiency in cardiopulmonary bypass circuits.\n\nWe evaluate pump performance using pressure-volume loop analysis and ventricular function monitoring that captures device-heart interaction throughout cardiac cycles. Our catheterization laboratories feature mock circulation systems replicating normal and failing heart conditions with continuous cardiac output measurement, ventricular pressure monitoring, and echocardiographic imaging tracking hemodynamic responses across physiological stress conditions. Specialized surgical models enable driveline tunneling assessment and percutaneous site evaluation. Hemocompatibility testing quantifies hemolysis indices, platelet activation markers, and von Willebrand factor degradation using ISO 10993-4 protocols adapted for chronic continuous-flow environments.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide long-term implantation assessment while FDA guidance documents for ventricular assist devices inform protocol development addressing pump durability, electrical safety, and infection resistance requirements. Our GLP-compliant testing supports PMA pathways for Class III life-sustaining devices. Whether validating next-generation miniaturized LVADs, percutaneous temporary support platforms, or biventricular assist systems, our protocols demonstrate mechanical reliability, hemocompatibility performance, and anatomical integration that bridge-to-transplant and destination therapy indications demand.",
