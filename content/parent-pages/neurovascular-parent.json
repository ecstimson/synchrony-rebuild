    "title": "Our Preclinical Expertise",
    "description": "Neurovascular devices restore cerebral blood flow or occlude vascular malformations, requiring validation that demonstrates effective treatment while preventing vessel perforation, distal embolization, and intracranial hemorrhage. Mechanical thrombectomy systems must navigate tortuous cerebrovascular anatomy to engage and retrieve clots without damaging fragile vessel walls. Liquid embolic agents demand controlled precipitation enabling aneurysm occlusion without migration to normal vessels. Flow diversion stents require precise deployment in curved intracranial segments while maintaining parent vessel patency. Each platform category presents unique challenges from clot-device interaction mechanics to embolic agent polymerization kinetics under cerebral blood flow conditions.\n\nWe evaluate device navigation using anatomically accurate cerebrovascular models replicating internal carotid artery tortuosity, middle cerebral artery branching patterns, and circle of Willis geometry. Our neurovascular testing laboratories feature high-resolution fluoroscopy, angiographic imaging, and micromanometer pressure monitoring that captures intracranial pressure changes, flow restoration dynamics, and vessel wall stress throughout intervention sequences. Specialized protocols assess clot engagement forces, retrieval success rates, and residual stenosis following mechanical thrombectomy. For embolic agents, controlled flow circuits measure precipitation timing, filling completeness, and migration resistance. Biocompatibility testing addresses unique cerebrovascular requirements including minimal inflammatory response and endothelial healing assessment.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide material evaluation while device-specific protocols address navigation through cerebrovascular tortuosity, deployment precision, and treatment effectiveness. Our GLP-compliant testing supports both 510(k) and PMA pathways for neurovascular devices. Whether validating next-generation stent retrievers, aspiration catheter platforms, or novel embolic formulations, our protocols demonstrate navigation capability, treatment efficacy, and vessel preservation that acute stroke and aneurysm treatment indications demand.",
