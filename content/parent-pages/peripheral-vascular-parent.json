    "title": "Our Preclinical Expertise",
    "description": "Peripheral vascular devices restore perfusion to limbs and organs through scaffolding, exclusion, or filtration, requiring validation that demonstrates durability under biomechanical stresses absent in coronary circulation. Superficial femoral artery stents endure compression, flexion, and torsion throughout gait cycles while carotid platforms balance plaque coverage against embolic particle release during deployment. AAA endografts must achieve durable seal zones preventing endoleak while accommodating vessel tortuosity and angulation. Drug-eluting peripheral platforms demand long lesion coverage with sustained antiproliferative activity addressing different restenosis mechanisms than coronary applications. Each territory presents unique challenges from limb movement biomechanics to varying vessel compliance and disease morphology.\n\nWe evaluate mechanical performance through compression testing, flexion protocols, and torsion assessment replicating physiological loading conditions in femoropopliteal segments. Our vascular testing laboratories feature anatomically accurate models spanning carotid bifurcations, aortic aneurysm geometries, and lower extremity vessel configurations including calcification patterns and tortuosity. Deployment characterization employs high-resolution imaging tracking stent expansion, graft apposition, and seal zone quality. For drug-eluting platforms, release kinetics assessment addresses extended elution supporting long lesion treatment. Embolic protection evaluation quantifies particle capture efficiency across size ranges while flow preservation protocols ensure adequate perfusion maintenance.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide material evaluation while ISO 25539 specifications inform mechanical testing requirements for peripheral vascular stents. Device-specific standards address AAA endograft assessment and embolic protection system characterization. Our GLP-compliant testing supports both 510(k) and PMA pathways across peripheral vascular categories. Whether validating next-generation nitinol stent platforms, modular endograft systems, or novel embolic protection technologies, our protocols demonstrate mechanical durability, deployment precision, and clinical performance that peripheral vascular indications demand.",
