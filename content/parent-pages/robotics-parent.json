    "title": "What We Test",
    "description": "Robotic-assisted surgical systems enhance procedural precision through tremor filtration, motion scaling, and articulated instrument control, requiring validation that demonstrates mechanical reliability while maintaining tactile feedback and surgical accuracy. Neurovascular platforms must navigate tortuous cerebrovascular anatomy with submillimeter precision while endovascular systems balance catheter control against operator radiation exposure reduction. Surgical robotic platforms demand articulation characterization across multiple degrees of freedom while force feedback assessment ensures appropriate tissue interaction. Each application category presents unique validation challenges from remote control latency in catheter steering to suturing precision in confined anatomical spaces.\n\nWe evaluate robotic system performance using precision measurement fixtures that quantify positional accuracy, force transmission fidelity, and control responsiveness across complete range of motion. Our robotic testing laboratories feature anatomically accurate surgical models, vascular phantoms replicating target vessel tortuosity, and specialized sensors measuring instrument forces, articulation angles, and tip positioning. Imaging system integration assessment validates fluoroscopic and ultrasound compatibility while radiation dosimetry protocols quantify operator exposure reduction. Tremor filtration characterization employs accelerometer-based measurement tracking frequency attenuation and motion scaling accuracy. Software validation addresses control algorithm performance, fail-safe mechanisms, and emergency override functionality.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide blood-contacting component assessment while IEC 60601 electrical safety standards inform robotic system validation. Software as a Medical Device guidance addresses algorithm verification and validation requirements. Device-specific protocols characterize articulation mechanics, force feedback accuracy, and procedural workflow integration. Our GLP-compliant testing supports PMA pathways for Class II and Class III robotic systems. Whether validating next-generation catheter steering platforms, articulated surgical instruments, or integrated imaging-navigation systems, our protocols demonstrate mechanical precision, control reliability, and procedural safety that robotic-assisted intervention indications demand.",
