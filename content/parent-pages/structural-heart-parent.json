    "title": "What We Test",
    "description": "Structural heart devices correct valvular dysfunction through transcatheter delivery, requiring validation that demonstrates precise deployment in beating hearts while preventing paravalvular leak, coronary obstruction, and conduction disturbances. Transcatheter valve platforms must achieve accurate positioning within diseased native valves or annular structures while maintaining stable anchoring forces throughout 200-400 million cardiac cycles. Edge-to-edge repair systems demand controlled leaflet grasping without tissue damage while LAA closure devices require complete sealing preventing thrombus formation. Each platform category presents unique deployment challenges from calcified aortic valve navigation to D-shaped mitral annulus conformability.\n\nWe evaluate deployment precision using high-resolution fluoroscopy and echocardiographic imaging that captures device positioning, expansion symmetry, and interaction with surrounding structures throughout complete delivery sequences. Our catheterization laboratories feature pressure-gradient measurement systems, Doppler flow analysis, and contrast imaging protocols quantifying paravalvular leak severity, coronary flow preservation, and hemodynamic performance. Specialized anatomical models replicate patient-specific valve pathologies including bicuspid aortic anatomy, functional mitral regurgitation, and challenging LAA morphologies. Durability testing protocols simulate years of cyclic loading through ISO 5840 accelerated wear assessment.\n\nISO 5840 heart valve standards guide structural and hydrodynamic testing while FDA guidance documents for transcatheter heart valve systems inform protocol development addressing deployment characterization, durability requirements, and biocompatibility assessment. Our GLP-compliant testing supports PMA pathways for Class III structural heart devices. Whether validating next-generation balloon-expandable valves, self-expanding platforms, or novel repair technologies, our protocols demonstrate deployment accuracy, hemodynamic performance, and chronic durability that regulatory submissions demand.",
